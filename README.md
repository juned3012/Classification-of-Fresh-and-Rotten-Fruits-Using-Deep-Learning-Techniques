# Classification of Fresh and Rotten Fruits Using Deep Learning Techniques<br>
• Designed a robust classification system to distinguish between fresh and rotten fruits, specifically apples, bananas, and oranges.<br>
• Utilized a dataset sourced from Kaggle comprising approximately 5,989 images of apples, bananas, and oranges, categorized as fresh or rotten.<br>
• Three deep learning models—Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), VGG16, and ResNet50—were employed for classifying fresh and rotten fruits.<br>
The CNN model demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 96.78%, utilizing its capacity for intricate feature extraction.<br>
